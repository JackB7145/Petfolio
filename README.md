# üêæ Petfolio ‚Äî Unified Pet Management Platform

## **Overview**

**Petfolio** is a centralized platform designed to organize, manage, and share every aspect of your pet‚Äôs health and life ‚Äî from medical history and diet to behavioral notes and veterinary visits. The platform transforms fragmented, disorganized pet data into a single, actionable source of truth for pet owners and veterinarians.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Pet owners often maintain their pets‚Äô medical and behavioral records across multiple systems ‚Äî vet portals, spreadsheets, paper documents, or memory. This results in:

* Lost or incomplete medical history when changing veterinarians.
* Difficulty tracking diet changes, allergies, or medications.
* Inefficiencies during vet visits ‚Äî requiring owners to recall or summarize key details.
* No standardized format for sharing critical information quickly (e.g., during emergencies or travel).

---

## **Solution**

Petfolio provides an integrated digital record system that:

* **Stores structured pet data** ‚Äî name, age, breed, physical characteristics, diet, and behavioral notes.
* **Logs medical history** ‚Äî vaccinations, surgeries, prescriptions, and allergies.
* **Supports ‚Äúissue reports‚Äù** ‚Äî where owners can raise health concerns.

  * Automatically summarizes key info (history, diet, medications, last vet visit).
  * Exports a **printable/shareable PDF** report for veterinarians.
* **Optionally syncs** with participating vet clinics for direct record transfer (future phase).
